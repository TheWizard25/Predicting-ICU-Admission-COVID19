# Predicting-ICU-Admission-COVID19
The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us the unpreparedness of our current healthcare system and services. We need to optimize the allocation of medical resources to maximize the utilization. We are preparing this Machine Learning model based on the clinical data of confirmed COVID-19 cases. This will help us to predict the need of ICU for a patient in advance. By this information hospitals can plan the flow of operations and take critical decisions like shifting patient to another hospital or arrangement of resources within the time so that the lives of patients can be saved.
